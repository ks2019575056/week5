vi Commands
vi commands are used in "screen" mode (the default), where 
you use the commands to move around the screen and to per-
from operations on the text.

Most vi commands follow a general pattern:
	[command][numver]textobject
or the equivalent form:
	[number][command]textobject

Movement Commands

vi movement commands distinguish between two kinds of
"worlds."The lowercase commands define a word as a contig-
uous sequence of underscores, letters, and digits. The upper-
case commands define a word as a contiguous sequence of
nonwhitespace characters.
